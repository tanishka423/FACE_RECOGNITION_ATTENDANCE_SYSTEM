# FACE_RECOGNITION_ATTENDANCE_SYSTEM
In this digital era, face recognition system plays a vital role in almost every sector. Face recognition is one of the mostly used biometrics. It can used for security, authentication, identification, and has got many more advantages. Despite of having low accuracy when compared to iris recognition and fingerprint recognition, it is being widely used due to its contactless and non-invasive process. Furthermore, face recognition system can also be used for attendance marking in schools, colleges, offices, etc. This system aims to build a class attendance system which uses the concept of face recognition as existing manual attendance system is time consuming and cumbersome to maintain. And there may be chances of proxy attendance. Thus, the need for this system increases. This system consists of four phases- database creation, face detection, face recognition, attendance updation.
